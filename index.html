<p>The second day in Maiorca (I&rsquo;m here for my company annual retreat) started with a very nice breakfast with a wonderful view on the sea.</p>
<p>We had a few sessions during the day (unfortunately I can&rsquo;t talk about them) followed by some relaxing time next to the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The weather is nice and in my spare time I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on the last few things being prepared for the next PyCon Italy.</p>
